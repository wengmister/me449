    "visually checking if the robot appears to swing to the same height (same potential energy) each\n",
    "swing. Choose values of dt (a) where the energy appears nearly constant (without choosing dt\n",
    "unnecessarily small) and (b) where the energy does not appear constant (because your timestep\n",
    "is too coarse). Capture a video for each case and note the dt chosen for each case. Explain how\n",
    "you would calculate the total energy of the robot at each timestep if you wanted to plot the total\n",
